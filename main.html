        +-- CALENDAR'S FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS --+ ANALYSIS
        - show the days inside a monthly container
        - user can click on a day to select it
        - a selected day should be highlighted somehow
        - user should see meetings assigned to the currently selected day
        - user should be able to add a new meeting to the selected day
        - meeting info should include meeting time and meeting description
        - we should display a new day that has been entered as soon as it is created
        - show a dropdown menu for the time picker
        
        +-- NICE TO HAVE --+
        - if a day has some meetings assigned it should be distinguichable somehow
        - user should be able to delete and change the meetings
        - we want to persist the data the user put in
        - we have to read persisted data as soon as we load the calendar 
        
        +-- NICE TO HAVE THAT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE --+
        - user should be able to move across several months
        - we should display the actual days for the selected month (and the month/year)
        - we should display the day-of-the-week for eacch day

        +-- THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO IMPLEMENT --+ DESIGN
        
            -- HTML ELEMENTS --
        - a container for the month itself
        - the days themselves (dynamically generated)
        - a header for the month
        - a container for the meetings (of the selected day)
        - the actual meetings
        - a container for "create a new meeting" section
        - some inputs to collect new meeting details

            -- CSS CLASSES --
        - generic day
        - currently selected day
        - days that have some meetings assigned
        - style for: inputs / meetings

            -- FUNCTIONS -- 
        - get the current month
        - get the number of days that the current month has
        - create as many days as we need
        - select a day (when user clicks on it)
        - we should structure our day/meeting related data in order to be able to access them inividually
        - create a new meeting based on the user input
        - every day should have from 0 to N meetings assigned to
        - display all meetings for the selected day
        - delete a meeting
        - store/ retrieve meeting data from the disk
        - style each day properly (IE: selected or not/has meetings...)
        - modify meeting details (also show them into editable field)
