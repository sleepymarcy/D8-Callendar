        +-- CALENDAR'S FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS --+
        - show the days inside a monthly container
        - user can click on a day to select it
        - a selected day should be highlighted somehow
        - user should see meetings assigned to the currently selected day
        - user should be able to add a new meeting to the selected day
        - meeting info should include meeting time and meeting description
        - we should display a new day that has been entered as soon as it is created
        - show a dropdown menu for the time picker
        
        +-- NICE TO HAVE --+
        - if a day has some meetings assigned it should be distinguichable somehow
        - user should be able to delete and change the meetings
        - we want to persist the data the user put in
        - we have to read persisted data as soon as we load the calendar 
        
        +-- NICE TO HAVE THAT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE --+
        - user should be able to move across several months
        - we should display the actual days for the selected month (and the month/year)
        - we should display the day-of-the-week for eacch day
